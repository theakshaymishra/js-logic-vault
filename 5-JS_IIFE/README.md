# JavaScript – Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

This repository contains **well-structured JavaScript examples** explaining the concept of  
**Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**.

The goal of this repo is to understand:
- Why IIFE was introduced
- How it works internally
- How it solves scope-related problems
- How it behaves with parameters, return values, and arrow functions

---

## What is an IIFE?

An **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)** is a JavaScript function that is executed **immediately after it is defined**.

Unlike normal functions, an IIFE:
- Does not need to be called explicitly
- Executes automatically
- Does not pollute the global scope

---

## Where to See Examples

All examples are provided in the `IIFE-examples.js` file.  
This includes:
- Basic IIFE syntax
- IIFE with parameters
- IIFE returning values
- Arrow function IIFEs
- Function call vs return value examples
